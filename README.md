# Instagram-Unfollow-Remover
InstagramUnfollowRemover is an application that detects and removes those followings who don't follow back.
- Login to an Instagram account to check who didn't follow back you
- Login to your personal Instagram account to remove those users

Two different applications are included

Step 1: 
- Instagram followings don't follow back checker (login required)
- Login to the Instagram account on the Firefox browser is required before running the automated application
- Simply copy-paste the Instagram username that you'd like to check in the application

Step 2: 
- Instagram followings don't follow back remover (your personal Instagram login required)

Since Instagram has been continually updating its algorithms and implementing measures to identify and prevent automated activities, therefore, I have been trying my best to optimize the application for account suspension, restriction of features, or even permanent banning.
